# DOMUM
Domum is a hobby project. I was looking for a super minimalist home page that remebers me on all devices. Something with somewhat dynamic content, time of day based backgrounds, daily goals, quotes, etc.

Not sure how much of that will make it into this project but this is the start of it.

PRs are welcome (if anyone even discovers this)!
